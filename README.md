# Caption Generator

This is my first React project with dynamic components,  
In simple terms it is an app that allows you to write captions on top of generated images from <a href="https://imgflip.com/" target="_blank">imgflip.com</a>

The app utilizes:
-  React Props to dynamically render text from both inputs, as well as to render the generated image
-  React **useEffect** hook to properly handle receiving image links from a Fetch GET request 
-  React **useState** to then manage the generated text and image between renders

### 
A deployed version of the app can be found <a href="https://moonlit-zabaione-9214cd.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>
